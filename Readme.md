# LinkedIn Applicants Counter Extension

When you have LinkedIn premium you can see the applicant count for a job below the job description. It can get tiresome to scroll down for every job to see the applicant count. This extension will show the applicant count for the job you are currently viewing in the top right corner of the page.

You can even set custom limit for the applicant count. If the applicant count is greater than the limit, the count will be shown in red color. By default the limit is set to 300.
