Thank you for using the **LinkedIn Applicant Count Popup** Chrome extension (the "Extension"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our Extension.

## 3. Permissions and Data Usage
The Extension requests certain permissions to function properly:
- **Access to LinkedIn pages:** This is required to extract and display applicant count information.
- **Reading page content:** The Extension analyzes LinkedIn job postings to provide relevant data but does not transmit or store any of this information.

## 4. Cookie Usage
The Extension requires access to cookies only for LinkedIn domains to function properly. These cookies are necessary to:
